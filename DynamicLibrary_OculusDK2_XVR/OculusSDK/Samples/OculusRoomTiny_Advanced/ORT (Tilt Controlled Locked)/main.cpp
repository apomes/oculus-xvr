/// This sample is an extension of the 'tilt controlled' sample, 
/// but now, in order to not lose so much of the view as you tilt,
/// we will start to lock off the pitch and roll, to half of their
/// values.  This is very interesting, because it supports a perception
/// that it is not you that is rotating, but the world that is doing so.
/// Press '1' to disable the effect, although not advised to go 
/// to and fro as its a non-natural transition.
/// When space is held, as in prior sample, to cease movement, we 
/// then find the reduced tilt/roll weird, as there is no accompanying 
/// acceleration, leading us to believe that the two should act in tandem.  BUT HOW TO TRANSITION???
/// IDEALLY, REALLY NEED TO PRECISELY MATCH WHAT GRAVITY IS DOING, NOT VAGUELY RIGHT AS THIS IS.
/// FURTHER RESEARCH IS TO DOUBLE THE EFFECT, BUT THEN CAP IT, AND ONCE CAPPED, THEN CONTINUE WITH 100% TILT and ROLL
